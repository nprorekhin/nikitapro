title: 'About Me'
---

My name is Nikita and I am passionate about software craftsmanship, new technologies and human interaction. 

I enjoy working on comprehensive and interesting tasks, that give me new experience and a kick of dopamine. 

I'm also an occasional runner, snowboarder, motorcycle fan, and a coffee lover.
